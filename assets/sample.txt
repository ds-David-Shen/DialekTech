okay first Formula we're going to look at these Q equals any quantity of charge in coulombs C for the unit that end is the number of electrons in Salerno units cuz it's a number is the charge on one electron to constant do you have to be given that 1.6 the negative 19 the one electron has that many coulombs of charge the two electrons would be two times at that's where the formula comes from some people like to write the formula like this because if you write it like this equals 2/8 + 2 quick problem is quite simple how many electrons are referees are in 280 coulombs of charge for a given we know they're so that's cute
